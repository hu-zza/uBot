The μBot is an educational floor robot based on ESP8266. It's still a prototype (v2.0).
  
  
## The μBot project

  - This repository summarize the whole project.
  - The driver files are in [hu-zza/uBot_firmware](https://github.com/hu-zza/uBot_firmware)
  - The PCB files are in [hu-zza/uBot_PCB](https://github.com/hu-zza/uBot_PCB)
  - The 3D files will be in [hu-zza/uBot_frame](https://github.com/hu-zza/uBot_frame)

## PCB

The design allows great flexibility in assembling. You can use SMT (surface-mount technology), THT (through-hole technology), or the mix of these. The "easy solderability" is my primary aim, so the solder pads are oversized too and the surface is not so dense.
